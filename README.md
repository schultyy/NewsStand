# NewsStand
I began to write this piece of software because I want to read recommendations on PC's where I can't access the quote.fm site all the time.

# Limitations
At the moment this client uses the *read only API*. For write API you have to name some sort of return url. That's not that easy for a desktop client. 
For performance reasons I only download the latest 5 recommendations / user. If you want to see more, you need to visit the website.

# Features
	⁃	Get your timeline
	⁃	Mark recommendations for later reading (does not sync with website)
# Requirements
	## For usage
	⁃	You need to install .Net 4 Client Profile. That should be all.
## For development
	⁃	Git
	⁃	Visual Studio 2010
